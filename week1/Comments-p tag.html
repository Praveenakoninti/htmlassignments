 <b>Heading</b>
  <p>Inline elements are displayed in relation to each other by stacking horizontally, one after another, within their containing element or text line. This means that inline elements are positioned side by side horizontally in the order they appear in the HTML markup. They flow within the text line or content and do not cause line breaks or new lines to start.

    By default, inline elements are displayed inline and take up only the necessary width to accommodate their content. If the available space is not sufficient to display all the inline elements in a single line, they may wrap to the next line based on the width constraints or the CSS properties applied.
    
    It's important to note that the specific layout and positioning of inline elements can be further controlled and modified using CSS properties and styles such as margins, padding, display, and positioning.</p>
